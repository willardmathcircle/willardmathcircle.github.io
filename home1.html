# Project 0

I have created a website for a Middle School Math Circle (Willard Math Circle), which provides resources and an overview of what the circle is through links, images, and writing. The file "home.html" gives the home page of the website (which is still under development), complete with a browser tab icon and a navigation bar (which was coded by a table of links). I used an @media query to make it so that when the page shrinks the navigation bar adapts accordingly.

The first hyper-link will take you to "about.html", which gives a popout window (a Bootstrap component) which gives some information about the creator, shows the logo of the school, and has three remaining sections to explain the purpose and intent of the circle. This was coded using the grid model in Bootstrap.

Next, you can continue on to the Resources Page, "resources.html", which contains an unordered list of links to previous lectures contained in public Google Docs.

Finally, there's a hyper-link to "contact.html" which gives the email address for which to contact for additional information.

As for the "styles.scss" file, I stylized all the content of the page to make it more visually appealing, such as basic aesthetic changes (colors, sizes, and fonts), making use of variables, nesting, and inheritance. I used both id and class throughout my file to make the stylization easier.

NOTE: The 5 css selectors I used were (#id - #lecture_links), (.class - .large_td), (element - body), (element.class - h1.title), (element, element - a, #lecture_links).
