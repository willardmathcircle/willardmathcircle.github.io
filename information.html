            <p class="what_is_it_info">​A math circle differs from a typical middle school math club in the intent.
              Instead of covering standard curriculum, a math circle explores branches of math that a formal education doesn't,
              immersing students into mathematics through puzzles, explorations, and collaboration. Competition preparation is often included,
              but math circles often ask students to think mathematically and develop strategies for tackling math at all levels.
              Most importantly, a math circle is a place for students to have fun and engage with math in a unique way!</p>

            <p class="the_three_ws">Imagine a game where you roll a 6-sided die until you get a 1. The amount of points you win is the square of the amount
              of rolls you made. For example, if you rolled the dice 3 times before you got a 1, you would win 9 dollars, 4 times would be 16 dollars, and so on.
              What’s the average amount of money you would earn?</p>
